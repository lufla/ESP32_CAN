# ESP32_CAN
ACAN 2.0, as a communication library for the ESP32 that manually implements the protocol on GPIO pins (bit-banging) without using the built-in TWAI controller. This project is intended to demonstrate low-level protocol logic and is not suitable for production use, although it is a working solution the the ESP32 with an external RX/TX CAN COntroller
